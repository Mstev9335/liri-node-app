# liri-node-app
This application allows the user to enter in command line arguments and receive relevant data back.  The app uses the Bands in Town API to search for upcoming events for a particular artist, the Spotify API to search for songs, the OMDB API to search for movies, and uses the fs node package to read from a .txt file and perform the liri command that is contained within.
